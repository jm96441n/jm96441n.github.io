        </div>
        <div>
           <p> Let me take this area to tell you a little about myself. I grew up on Long Island, New York and have been living in Brooklyn for the past 10 years. I began my college work in 2006 and I completed it in 2010 with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics from Pace University, which is located right in Downtown Manhattan. From there I have held a few different jobs (as most surviving struggle that is New York City living do.) Initially out of school I was a server at a few different bars and restaurants throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan, while also doing work as a private math tutor. It was during this time that I embarked on a brief (yet intense) stint as an amateur Muay Thai and MMA fighter. I finished my fighting career undefeated with a record of 3-0, and decided to move on to some more academic pursuits more in line with my degree. This is where DBC came into my life. If you have any other questions about my background, educational experience, or anything at all really feel free to head on over to my contact page and send me an e-mail. Thanks for reading!
