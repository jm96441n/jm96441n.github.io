      <h2> CSS Concepts </h2>
    </section>
      <div>
        <p>When you are using CSS you will run into three tags that are very useful when you are positioning elements on your website and they are margin, border, and padding. At first glance they may seem very similar, but the subtle differences between them are what can separate a site that looks amazing from one that looks decent. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>This is the standard image that you will usually see when trying to research the difference between the three attributes. Looks a bit confusing right? There's a lot going on there, let's use a simpler example, and then look back at this and make some sense of it.</p>
      <div>
        <img src="../imgs/pbm_image.jpg"/>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>To begin, the padding is the area between the element and the border. The border is the definitive edge of the element. The margin is the area between the border and the next element. A good analogue is a house with a fence. Think of the house as the element, the lawn between the house and the fence as the padding, the fence is the border, and any space outside of the fence before you get to your neighbors lawn is the margin.</p>
      </div> 

      <div>
        <img src="../imgs/house_comp.jpg"/>
      </div> 
      <div>
        <p>Now looking back at our first image we can make a little more sense out of all those boxes. So the content in the center is our element, from there you can see the padding which extends out to the border, and then the margin which extends out from the border. Three similar tags that can change the way your element is viewed in many different ways.</p>
