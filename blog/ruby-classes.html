      <h2> Ruby Classes </h2>
    </section>
    <p>Today we will be discussing Ruby Classes. A class is an object in Ruby which allows us to store and define methods that we can re-use without having to redefine each method. Now, that sounds much more intricate and difficult than it actually is. The easiest way to show you this is with a simple example. Let's make a class called Mathematics that will first greet the user by name and give them instructions, and then will allow them to perform different functions on the numbers your give. So this is what our class will look like (we'll break it down afterwards):
    </p>
    <p class="code"><code>
class Mathematics
  attr_reader :first_word
  attr_accessor :first_number, :second_number
  def initialize
    @first_word = 'Hello'
  end
  def greet(name)
    return "#{@first_word} #{name}! How are you today? Call the sum or 
    subtract method with the two numbers you with to 
    perform the operations on"
  end
  def sum(a,b)
    @first_number = a
    @second_number = b
    return a+b
  end
  def subtract(a,b)
    @first_number = a
    @second_number = b
    return a-b
  end
end
    </code></p>
    <p>
    This looks like a whole bunch of code, but lets break it down. So first we name our class (class Mathematics), after that we have these two lines "attr_reader" and "attr_accessor". All this does is tell us we have an instance variable (in attr_reader) that we can only access but cannot change, and another two variables stored as attr_accessor which allows us to access and change those variables. Before we go any further, let me tell you a bit about instance variables. All that means is that we can use this variable in more than just the method it's defined in. As we see above we use all the instance variables (the variables with the @ in front of the names) in more than one method. </p>

    <p class = 'code'><code>
        def initialize
          @first_word = 'Hello'
        end
    </code></p>
    <p>
    Now lets move on, the initialize method (which when you start making your own I guarantee you will misspell initialize more times than you can count) just tells us what our class is starting with. So we start with a variable that is defined and stores 'Hello' for us to use again. 
   </p>
   <p class = 'code'><code>
        def sum(a,b)
          @first_number = a
          @second_number = b
          return a+b
        end
    </code></p>
    <p>
    
    Next up we have our sum method. All we do here is say our first_number instance variable is equal to a, and our second_number instance variable is equal to b, and then we return the sum of them. Also, our subtract method does the exact same thing, only with subtraction instead of addition. Obviously we can do this in a much simpler way in Ruby, but here I wanted to give you simple examples so you can see how they work.</p>
    <p>
    
    Finally, how do we use all this? That's the easy part, let's look below:</p>
    <p class = 'code'><code>
      >> example = Mathematics.new
      >> p example.greet('John')
      >> "Hello John! How are you today? Call the sum or subtract 
      method with the two numbers you with to perform the 
      operations on"
      >> p example.sum(6,2)
      >> 8
      >> p example.subtract(6,2)
      >> 4
    </code></p>
    <p>
    So here we use our initialize (in the form of Mathematics.new) to start our class, and say we will be using it in our variable 'example'. Then we call the method greet (from the class Mathematics) with a name in order for it to print our greeting and instructions. Then we call the methods add and subtract with two numbers (6 and 2) and they print out the sum and difference of them.
    We can see how classes work with a very simple function (that we can easily make much simpler through some refactoring), but hopefully you can see how to extrapolate with class use from here. There are so many applications of classes, try and make some of your own to find out!</p>
