<!--
    1) How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
    I really enjoyed wireframing and creating an HTML page with a pair. I found the immediate feedback and working with a partner to bounce ideas off of to be really helpful and useful.
    2) Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process.
    I found wireframing to be very useful to the development process. It gave me a roadmap to follow when we were building our HTML.
    3) What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
    We decided that keeping the wireframe pretty simple was going to help us the most. That way we could have a basic idea of how our site would look, while also having be very flexible to any changes we wanted to make on the go.
    4) What new semantic elements did you learn about?
    I learned about rowspan in this exercise, it helped us to make an area for the actual blog post to go, while having the links to other blog post next to it.
