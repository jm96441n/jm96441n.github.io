      <h2> Enumerable Methods </h2>
    </section>
    <p class = 'scrollbox'> Today we will be looking at enumerable methods, mainly the <span class='methodname'>reduce</span> method. First let's start with what an enumerable method is. The best way to think of an enumerable method as one that can access each element of a block of information individually. So if we look at an array of numbers:
        <span class = 'code'> Array = [2,4,5,6,7,10] </span>
    Most methods will only be able to access the array as a whole, or you have to individually call each element you want to access. With enumerable methods you can automatically go through each element of the array and perform different functions depending on the enumerable you use.
    
     Now looking specifically at the <span class='methodname'>reduce</span> method. This method is very useful, but a little difficult to understand at first. Let me show you two basic examples and see if you can figure it out:
      <span class = 'code'>
        >>[1,2,3,4].reduce(:+)
        => 10
        >>[1,2,3,4].reduce(:*)
        => 24
      </span>
    Figure it out? So <span class='methodname'>reduce</span> takes all the elements and combines them based on the operator you give to it. Now you can go through and define your own operators, you're not limited to the ones that come with Ruby. In fact most of the time you have define your operation. For example:
      <span class = 'code'>
        >>[1,2,3,4].reduce(0) {|sum, element| sum + element}
        => 10
        >>[1,2,3,4].reduce(1) {|sum, element| sum + element}
        => 11
      </span>
    Now both of these are a variation on the addition example we used in the first block of code. The first one is a direct analogue of the addition we did for the first reduce method we called earlier. You can see the syntax is very similar to other enumerable methods we have learned. The difference comes in the second reduce we call. The argument in the second reduce we called here is set to '1' whereas the first one is set to '0'. All this does is tell us where to start from. So in this example where the argument is '0', we start adding from '0'. The computer processes this as:
      <span class = 'code'>
        >> 0+1+2+3+4
      </span>
    In the example where the argument is '1', we start adding with '1' and then add the rest of the elements. The computer processes this:
      <span class = 'code'>
        >> 1+1+2+3+4
      </span>
    Something else to keep in mind, which I wont go into here, is that you can call reduce on strings as well. So as you can see this method is very versatile, and is useful if you need to take a large amount of data or information and condense down to a single number or string easily.
