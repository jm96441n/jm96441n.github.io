      <span>Array's and Hashes</span>
    </section>
    <p> When coding with Ruby it is inevitable you will be using Array's and Hashes to store information. While they may seem very similar at first, there are a few key difference's between them that will dictate how you use them.</p>
    <pre><code> my_array=['cat','dog',1,3,'banana']</code></pre>
    <pre><code> my_hash = {
                        :cat => 'Tom'
                        :mouse => 'Jerry'
                        :movies => 5
                        :banana => 'Fruit'
                    }

    </code></pre>
    <p>So above we see an example of both, an array and a hash. As you can see they both store information, but it's stored differently between the two of them. Where the array stores singluar, unrelated pieces of information, the hash has information (in a :key => value form) attached to each other. Just from this you can infer that hashes and arrays are useful in their own ways.
    For example, an array would be useful for storing lists of people in different classes. So your code might look like this:</p>
    <pre><code> 
           English_Class = ['John','Veronica', 'Michael','Andrea','Paul',]
           Math_Class = ['Erica','Billy','Kayla','Jeff']
           History_Class = ['Christina','Alfonso','Josh','Kendra']
    </code></pre>
    <p>As you can see, there are multiple singlular forms of information, that are only attached to the array, but not each other.
    Now we have hashes. Hashes are more useful for storing information that should be attached to another piece of information. A database of movie ratings or a list of items with their prices in a store are two examples of uses of hashes. A hash for prices of items in a store might look something like this:</p>
    <pre><code> Prices = {
            :baseball => 3.95
            :basketball => 7.95
            :socks => 4.99
            :hat => 6.99
        }
    </code></pre>
    <p>So with hashes, we are storing multiple pairs of information, that are called in tandem when we need to use them.
    
    Hopefully this explanation helped you to understand the differences between array's and hashes!</p>
