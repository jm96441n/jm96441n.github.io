        <h2>Array's and Hashes</h2>
    </section>
   <p> When coding with Ruby it is inevitable you will be using Array's and Hashes to store information. While they may seem very similar at first, there are a few key difference's between them that will dictate how you use them.</p>
   <p> <code> my_array=['cat','dog',1,3,'banana']</code></p>
   <p><code> my_hash = {
                        :cat => 'Tom'
                        :mouse => 'Jerry'
                        :movies => 5
                        :banana => 'Fruit'
                    }

   </code></p>
   <p> So above we see an example of both, an array and a hash. As you can see they both store information, but it's stored differently between the two of them. Where the array stores singluar, unrelated pieces of information, the hash has information (in a :key => value form) attached to each other. Just from this you can infer that hashes and arrays are useful in their own ways.</p> 
   <p>For example, an array would be useful for storing lists of people in different classes. So your code might look like this:
    <code> English_Class = ['John','Veronica', 'Michael','Andrea','Paul',]
           Math_Class = ['Erica','Billy','Kayla','Jeff']
           History_Class = ['Christina','Alfonso','Josh','Kendra']
    </code>
    As you can see, there are multiple singlular forms of information, that are only attached to the array, but not each other.</p>
    <p> Now we have hashes. Hashes are more useful for storing information that should be attached to another piece of information. A database of movie ratings or a list of items with their prices in a store are two examples of uses of hashes. A hash for prices of items in a store might look something like this:
        <code> Prices = {
            :baseball => 3.95
            :basketball => 7.95
            :socks => 4.99
            :hat => 6.99
        }
    So with hashes, we are storing multiple pairs of information, that are called in tandem when we need to use them.</p>
    <p>Hopefully this explanation helped you to understand the differences between array's and hashes!</p>
