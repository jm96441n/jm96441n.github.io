      What are the benefits of version control?
      One of the main benefits of version control is that you can more accurately keep track of your work, and test new changes with a long history of back ups. For example, if a change to your code does not work, you can easily go back to a previous working version.

        How does git help you keep track of changes?
        Git helps you to keep track of changes, by keeping a version of every commit you save. That way you can easily compare your current work to all of your past updates to your program.

        Why use Github to store your code?
        Github is an excellent tool to store your code, because it is stored remotley. That way you can access your code from anywhere, and if you have a hard drive failure, all your work will not be lost.
